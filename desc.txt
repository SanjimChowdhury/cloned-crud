This application followed the Zell tutorial on CRUD, nodejs mongoDB, later on we added mongoose for
database conncection, pay a read to their tutorial
*Features of this application is you can add quotes, then update em and delete them, also we're saving
quotes in the database later on randering them inside html.

Mongoose conncection
steps,
1. we're keeping the mongoose conncetion inside config/db.js, remember how we were conncected on
server.js by simply calling the function connectDB().
2. keeping the MONGO_URI inside config/config.env

Mongoose Schema
1. We kept the schema structure inside the model directory and Character.js file
2. Then we declared the schema structure in server.js as Character const,
3. Then we used all mongoose method with that Character const to execute find, create ,deleteOne etc 
operation.
