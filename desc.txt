This application followed the Zell tutorial on CRUD, nodejs mongoDB, later on we added mongoose for
database conncection, pay a read to their tutorial
*Features of this application is you can add quotes, then update em and delete them, also we're saving
quotes in the database later on randering them inside html.

Mongoose conncection
steps,
1. we're keeping the mongoose conncetion inside config/db.js, remember how we were conncected on
server.js by simply calling the function connectDB().
2. keeping the MONGO_URI inside config/config.env

Mongoose Schema
1. We kept the schema structure inside the model directory and Character.js file
2. Then we declared the schema structure in server.js as Character const,
3. Then we used all mongoose method with that Character const to execute find, create ,deleteOne etc 
operation.


#The DELETE before MVC
1.
index.els => all the quotes that were saved in the database inside the collection quotes, we brought them
on line 30, using forEach loop.

<li class="quote" data-id="<%= el._id %>">
                <span><%= el.name %></span>:
                <span><%= el.quote %></span>
                <button onclick="deleteTodo(event)">Delete</button>
</li>
here the class="quote" will be used later for event handling,
^ el._id, here el is each document(individual quote saved inside quotes collection) and here we're
  taiking the _id as data-id to tie spans and button with a same list
